# Usage

This is a LaTeX template to generate a so-called 3-dimensional WWYD (What Would You Discard) image. Regular (2-dimensional) WWYDs typically have your hand only, whereas a 3-dimensional WWYD has more information, including discard ponds, scores of other players, etc. 

Unfortunately, I cannot remember where I downloaded the tile images at the moment. Please let me know if you know the sources, so I can cite it. 

I am thinking about incoporating the `\DrawHand` command from the [tikz-riichi](https://github.com/riichi/tikz-riichi) package, but this is currently not my priority.
